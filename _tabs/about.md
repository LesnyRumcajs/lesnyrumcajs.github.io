## About

Hello! I'm **Hubert**, a software engineer passionate about building rock-solid software. I'm currently leading a pack of Rust engineers at [ChainSafe Systems], where we are building [Forest], a Rust implementation of the [Filecoin] protocol and other projects in the ecosystem and general open-source software.

Team **vim** and **Linux**. Trust me, this is the year of Linux on desktop. I promise. üêß

> I promise not to AI-generate the posts in this blog. I might use it (along with Grammarly) to proofread, but that's about it.

## Expertise

With over 12 years of experience in the IT industry, I have developed a strong foundation in various technologies and programming languages across multiple domains. To name a few:
- C and C++ for embedded payment terminals, massive cybersecurity systems and microservices. Pointer arithmetics and Turing-complete templates are fun. So is _undefined behaviour_ and `SIGSEGV`.
- Rust for high-performance microservices and blockchain applications. I failed miserably at preaching Rust to Java engineers.
- Kafka and gRPC for microservices communication. My favourite saying during the standup is _no brokers_.
- Terraform and Terragrunt for Infrastructure as Code. I like it when it works. I don't like it when it doesn't. I also don't like when it works, but the code is not in the repo.
- Docker and Kubernetes for containerization and orchestration. It works on your machine? Great! Let's ship your machine!
- GitHub Actions and Gitlab for CI/CD. YAML development at its finest.

and many more, some of which left terrible scars. [I also ate a lot of shoe leather] and fell into the [timezones madness]. Don't ask me about them. Ever.

I worked in companies of different shapes and sizes, from startups to large corporations, using various methodologies, from Sc[r]um to Waterfall. I mostly ended up with Kanban on steroids. This is the Way.

> Go to a local grocery shop, petrol station or convenience store in Poland. You will likely use a payment terminal I helped develop from the ground up. :)

For the past few years, I have been involved in the [Filecoin] project, where I have been working on different aspects of the ecosystem, including:
- Building and maintaining [Forest], a Rust implementation of the Filecoin protocol.
- Contributing to various Filecoin projects, including [FVM] and the [Filecoin Built-in Actors].
- Smaller contributions to other ecosystem projects, such as [rust-libp2p] and [Lotus].

I'm also the co-author and maintainer of [gRPC bench]. Almost a thousand ‚≠ê which is the only correct way to measure the quality of the project!
